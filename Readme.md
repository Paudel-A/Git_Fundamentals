# Hi, I am new to github and I am planning to do this the right way.
# As I work through operating git through the command line I will be publishing the process that I went through.
# I will create a cheatsheet for the command line codes so I can refrence it in the near future for a quick view.

# Created a Test branch that should not be merged with the main/master branch until I merge it. 
# Sucessfully merged the Test branch with my main branch.
